			<h1>Introduction to coding</h1>
			<p>My first experience with coding was way back in lower secondary school, about 15 years ago. All I remember is making a calculator with the language we used. After that, I have come across coding in multiple instances but have always been too intimidated by it to give it a try. That lasted until the end of last year (2023). That is when I got more interested in developing games and, with it, coding. It's not like coding is needed by every person making games, but it would nonetheless be useful.
				<br><br>
				I ended up starting with Python. Since that is a popular language used in many things, one of those uses is in game development. I did learn some of the basics, but I just didn't put enough time into learning Python. I also didn't use the best tools and learning platforms out there. I simply didn't know what to look for. Additionally, I did not do enough small coding projects. Which would have helped to see my progress and give me the feeling of achieving something.
				<br><br>
				Well, things still went forward, and I got a work try-out place in a company making websites. While I did have some knowledge about coding and UX design going into it, practically, I was going to start from zero. However, now I would have people right around me to guide me and answer any questions I might have. I will tell you more about my experience in the next blog post.

			<h1>Learning begins</h1>
			<p><b>First day</b>
				<br>
				It was a pretty normal first day. I was shown where to work and given the password to log into the computer and the company's Microsoft 365. This provided me with the basic tools I needed, such as email and the Teams platform. After that, I dove straight into learning HTML on freely available courses from W3Schools and Codecademy. I instantly got absorbed in it, and the day just flew by.

				<b>My First Two Weeks of Coding: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>
				<br>
				Embarking on the journey of learning to code has been nothing short of exhilarating. The first two weeks of diving into HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript have been engaging. All the brainwork has been quite exhausting but in a good way. Since the interest has not dropped and there is probably even more will to continue learning.
