I am learning coding by making my own website. Comments and suggestions are welcome. -24

This project was left unfinished when I started my IT studies. I had been working on it during a work trial, but my focus shifted to practicing their web development tools.

I plan to revisit this project in the spring of 2025, during my studies' course on web development techniques (or potentially in a new repository).
